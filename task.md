You are expected to submit a single-spaced at least 1 page long (A4-sized) 2-column document (in pdf format) (formatted preferably with LaTeX using an IEEE conference template).

In this document you will explain:

a) the problem definition and motivation,

b) provide an overview of related work (referencing the relevant papers),

c)  present shortly the dataset(s) (if any) and the method that you plan to explore and what you plan to achieve. If there is a hypothesis involved provide it as well. The document should contain the project title, the group membersâ€™ names (and project responsibilities) and of course a list of references at its end. Font-type Arial (or equivalent), font-size 9.

d) present the performance metrics and success criteria (must be numerical and measurable) of your project.

The proposal will be evaluated in terms of writing quality, comprehensiveness, novelty and challenge level. All group members will submit individually the same proposal document.
