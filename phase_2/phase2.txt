Your report should:

start by recalling the problem and its motivation
provide a comprehensive description of relevant studies published in renowed journals and conferences.
present your so far activities subdivided into a theoretical design decisions along with their justifications and b) into experiments and results (if any). I expect to see visuals, figures, and tables with numerical results.
conclude with a summary of the work done so far, results that have been obtained and steps to be taken from now on.
Late submissions will not be accepted, so plan your submission carefully.

The report will be evaluated in terms of: comprehensiveness, suitability/justification level of the chosen methods for the task, amount of progress achieved and presentation/drafting/clarity of the report.
